I am Gokay, a senior physics student at Istanbul Technical University. I built this site to share my notes on the subjects I am currently studying. I know well that it can be challenging for a student to learn advanced topics independently, I have experienced these difficulties myself. That is why I want to share not only my notes but also the sources I used, and point out where you can learn even more beyond my notes.
