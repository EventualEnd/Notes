The first thing I studied when I began working independently on the ICTP QFT course was “Noether’s theorems, gauge symmetries and boundary terms” by Máximo Bañados and Ignacio Reyes. This was assigned to me by my thesis professor, Mehmet Özkan. Although I had already taken a classical mechanics course, there were still some gaps in my understanding. This review paper was wonderful for filling those gaps, and I learned a lot from it.

After that, my next assignment was to study the first part of Edward Witten’s paper “2 + 1 dimensional gravity as an exactly soluble system,” which focuses on Chern–Simons theory. I wouldn’t recommend this paper unless you already have some background in differential forms and the Poincaré group (I didn’t, which made it quite challenging). Still, for anyone looking for a challenge, it’s definitely worth attempting.
