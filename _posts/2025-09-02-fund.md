I have began studying independetly  first QFT course of ICTP but first assigment my thesis professor Mehmet Ozkan gave was "A short review on Noether's theorems, gauge symmetries and boundary terms" by Maximo Banados and Ignacio Reyes. I had taken classical mechanics course earlier but I knew that there were a few missing part that I did not learn, this  review paper was wonderful, I learnt a lot from it.
 My next assigment was studying first part of the paper about Chern Simons theory "2 + 1 dimensional gravity as an exactly soluble system"  by Edward Witten but I wouldn't suggest you to study it if you do not posessed knowledge about differentia forms and the poincare group (I did not know what those are and it was challenging, but the ones who wants some challenge may attempt.)
