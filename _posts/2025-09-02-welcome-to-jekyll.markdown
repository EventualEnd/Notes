This notes may have be under the GR notes but I wanted to seperate them to give more explicit information about them.
I have taken notes about Schwarzschild and RN Black Hole, but Kerr BH was good enough to study from the mainly one or two sources which I will explain. <br>

[Schwarzschild](/assets/files/sch1.pdf)<br>
[Charged Black Hole (RN)](/assets/files/chbh.pdf)<br>

To learn the Black Hole more than fundamental, you surely have a solid background of hypersurfaces (in general advanced GR would be better) and I can certainly advise you to study the GR videos of Eric Poisson which I have mentioned in the "Some notes on GR" part. After gaining GR background, Black Hole notes of Townsed is excellent for you, at the same time you can cross check some knowledges from Harvey Reall's Black Hole notes. Harvey Reall's notes are more mathematical and a bit advanced than Townsed.<br>
My notes might be helpful for some calculations. I did not take any notes for Kerr BH, notes of Townsed and Eric Poisson is way more than enough.
