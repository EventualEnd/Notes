I would recommend that you first study Classical Mechanics, ideally by taking a course or reviewing it on your own. You can check out the online course on Theoretical Mechanics offered by the Perimeter Institute (on PIRSA it may also appear under the name Classical Mechanics). There are many classical mechanics courses on PIRSA, but the one I studied was taught by David Kubiznak. It provides a geometrical perspective on classical mechanics as well as fundamentals of differential geometry. I strongly suggest studying this course before moving on to Advanced General Relativity. For the ones who like studying geometrical aspects of classical mechanics, I would suggest "Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics" by  Vladimir Arnold
