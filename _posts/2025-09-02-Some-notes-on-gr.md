For those who are not familiar with General Relativity, but have at least some background in Special Relativity (not required, but helpful), I will upload the notes I took when I attended a GR course at my university. Another useful introductory source is Relativity Demystified—I actually recommend the entire Demystified series written by David McMahon. There were also lecture notes on Gravitational Physics by Christopher Pope (I might be slightly misremembering the exact title), but I believe the website has since been taken down. In addition, you may want to check out the Perimeter Institute’s PIRSA video lectures on General Relativity (I have not personally watched them, but I trust they are good resources).

For those who want to learn more about General Relativity, especially its geometrical side, I strongly recommend A Relativist’s Toolkit by Eric Poisson. It is a challenging book for those studying independently, but do not worry—there is also a 24-lecture recorded course from the Perimeter Institute available on the PIRSA website. The course, called Advanced General Relativity, was recorded in the first months of 2024. You will likely enjoy it if you already have some fundamental GR knowledge. In the course, Poisson does not cover Chapter 4 of his book. However, once you work through Chapters 1, 2, and 3, Chapter 4 becomes much easier to read on your own. He also does not cover the entire book—some parts follow the style of other standard texts, but in the videos he emphasizes the more geometrical aspects of GR, which I personally found very engaging. I have also taken notes on the videos, which you can find below for Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 5.

For those who already have knowledge beyond the fundamentals (and you will certainly gain more than just the basics from Eric Poisson’s videos) and want to explore the more mathematical side of General Relativity, I recommend General Relativity by Robert Wald. In fact, Wald was recently honored with Dirac Medal—together with Gibbons, Kerr, and Horowitz—for his contributions. Studying Wald’s book after working through A Relativist’s Toolkit will definitely make the process easier.


I am currently studying Wald’s General Relativity, and I am planning to study Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime by Wald as well. In addition, I intend to follow the Perimeter Institute’s video courses on Mathematical Physics (Core) and Mathematical Physics (Elective), which I presume cover, more or less, the material from Nakahara’s book on geometry and topology.
