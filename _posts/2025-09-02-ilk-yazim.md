I am Gokay, a senior physics student in Istanbul Tehncial University. I built this site to share my notes on whatever I am studying on. I am well aware that it is a challange for a student to learn advanced topics by himself, I have suffered being myself and I want to share my notes and which sources you can learn more than my notes
, what sources I have used and so on.
