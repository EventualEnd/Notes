The ones who do not have any idea about GR, but for the ones who have a bit special relativity( it is not a must but would be useful), I will uploud the notes I have taken when I took the GR course in my university. Different side of fundamental source would be Relativity Demystified ( I would suggest Demystified series in general those written by David McMahon). There were notes of Christopher Pope on Gravitional Physics (I might remember the exact name wrong but you got the point) but I guess he removed the website I couldn't find it. You can also check the Perimeter's video on Pirsa about General Relativity ( I did not watch it but I am positive about it.)


For the ones who wanted to learn more about GR, and especially geometrical side of GR I would strongly suggest you to read the book Relativists Toolkit by Eric Poisson. It is a challenging book for the ones who study independetly but do not worry, there are 24 videos in Perimeter Institius recorded course in Pirsa website. The course called "Advanced General Relativity" and recorded in the first a months of 2024. You would like it if you have fundamental GR knowledge. He did not teach Ch4 of his book, but after you learn about ch1,ch2,ch3 it is very easy to read the ch4. He does not cover all part of the book, in the book he teachs similir to other books (it is good to know) but in the videos he teachs more geometrical side of the GR and I honestly loved it. I took notes of the videos you can find below ch1,ch2,ch3 and ch5.

[Congruences](/assets/files/Congruences.pdf)

[BlackHole](/assets/files/BlackHole.pdf)


For the ones who have knowledge more than fundamentals (you would surely learn more than fundamentals from Eric Poisson's videos) and wants to learn mathematical side of the GR which I am currently studying on, The book General Relativity by Robert Wald, which he shared the Dirac Field (interpreted as Nobel of the mathematics)this year with Gibbons, Kerr and Holowitz. Studying Wald's book after studying Relativists Toolkit would make your life easier.


I am currenlty studying Wald's GR, and planning to studying QFT in Curved Space by Wald and Perimeter's video on Mathematical Physics (Core) and Mathematical Physics (Elective) which I presume covers more or less Nakahara's book on geometry and topology.
