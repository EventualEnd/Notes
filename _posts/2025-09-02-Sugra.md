Two friends and I are working on writing a solution manual for the Supergravity book by Daniel Freedman and Antoine Van Proeyen. It may seem like an unusual choice of book, but we found it exciting because the research group of my thesis professor also uses this book. The questions that are multiples of 3 are the ones I have solved. So far, we have completed Chapters 1 and 2, and we plan to continue with the later chapters.
